## Synthesis task

Create an **executive synthesis** that:
- Summarises the key consensus in 2-3 sentences
- Lists 4-6 key findings as bullet points
- Notes any disagreements with brief analysis
- Highlights unique insights worth preserving

### Key principles

1. **Identify consensus**: What do multiple models agree on? This is likely reliable.

2. **Highlight unique insights**: What did only one model mention that's valuable?
   - Tag the source: "[From GPT-5.2]" or similar
   - Don't discard these just because others didn't mention them

3. **Flag disagreements**: Where do models contradict?
   - Present both positions fairly
   - Analyse which seems more credible and why

4. **Remove duplication**: Don't repeat the same point multiple times

5. **Preserve nuance**: Keep qualifications and uncertainty expressed by models

### Output format

### Executive summary
[2-3 sentences capturing the core answer]

### Key findings
- [Bullet points of main findings]

### Points of disagreement
- [Any contradictions, or "None significant" if models agreed]

### Unique insights
- **[Model name]**: [Notable insight only this model provided]

### Confidence level
[One sentence on how confident we should be based on model agreement]

You are synthesising brainstorming results from ${bestResponses.length} AI models. Each model was queried multiple times with temperature variation, and their responses were merged into comprehensive idea lists. Your job is to create the ultimate combined list.

## Original prompt

${originalPrompt}

## Merged ideas per model

${responsesSection}

---

## Synthesis task

Create a **comprehensive master list** of all ideas, organised into thematic clusters.

### Goals
1. **Include every unique idea** — if any model proposed it, include it
2. **Merge duplicates across models** — note when multiple models independently proposed the same idea (strong signal)
3. **Preserve the best framing** — for each idea, use whichever model's name and description was most compelling
4. **Tag sources** — after each idea, note which models proposed it in brackets
5. **Cluster by theme** — group related ideas under thematic headings

### Output format

For each theme:

### [Theme name]

1. **[Idea name]** — [Best 2-sentence description]. [Source models]
2. ...

Then at the end:

---

### Summary statistics
- Total unique ideas across all models: [count]
- Ideas proposed by multiple models independently: [count] (highest confidence)
- Ideas unique to one model: [count] (most novel)

### Top 5 most promising ideas
[Brief ranked list with 1-sentence justification each]
